Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.

We make it possible to:

Set up tests
Write tests
Run tests
Debug Tests
Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.

This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests.

Who uses Cypress?
Our users are typically developers or QA engineers building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.

Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:

End-to-end tests
Integration tests
Unit tests
Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cypress comes fully baked, batteries included. Here is a list of things it can do that no other testing framework can:

Time Travel: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.

Debuggability: Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Developer Tools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.

Automatic Waiting: Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
Spies, Stubs, and Clocks: Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing is right at your fingertips.

Network Traffic Control: Easily control, stub, and test edge cases without involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like.

Consistent Results: Our architecture doesnâ€™t use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.

Screenshots and Videos: View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI.

Cross browser Testing: Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers (including Edge and Electron) locally and optimally in a Continuous Integration pipeline.


---------------------------------------------------------
Setting up tests:
There are no servers, drivers, or any other dependencies to install or configure. You can write your first passing test in 60 seconds.
Writing tests:
Tests written in Cypress are meant to be easy to read and understand. Our API comes fully baked, on top of tools you are familiar with already.
Running tests:
Cypress runs as fast as your browser can render content. You can watch tests run in real time as you develop your applications. TDD FTW!
